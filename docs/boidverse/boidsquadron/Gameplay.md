# Boid Squadron

Boid Squadron is an infinite shooter where you control a Boid dart spaceship, moving left and right to intercept enemies before they reach your mothership. If enemies slip past you and hit the shield, your mothership loses HP.

## Controls  
- Keyboard: Move using A-D or the arrow keys.  
- Touch: Drag left or right on the screen to move.  

Your mission is to survive against increasingly difficult waves of enemies for as long as possible.

## Enemy Types  

- Miniships : These standard enemy ships move at an average speed, heading straight for your mothership. They have moderate HP and deal a small amount of damage if they get through.  

- Assassin Ships : These enemies are much faster but have lower health. However, they deal slightly higher damage when they reach the base.  

- Tank Ships / Mega Ships : These slow-moving enemies not only have high HP but also shift left and right, blocking other enemies behind them from your attacks. If they manage to get past you, they deal a massive amount of damage to the mothership.

## Energy Surge and Upgrades  

As you play, your energy bar gradually fills up over time. Once it reaches full capacity, you enter an Energy Surge, allowing you to choose one of two randomly presented upgrades.  

There are 18 different upgrades available, divided into two categories:  
- Muzzle Upgrades  Enhance your spaceship's firing capabilities.  
- Bullet Upgrades  Improve your bullets in various ways.  

Each game session allows you to obtain 9 upgrades in total, letting you mix and match between muzzle and bullet upgrades to create different builds.  

Once you've acquired all 9 upgrades, every subsequent Energy Surge presents you with a choice between two special powers:  
1. Heal : Restores 100 HP to your mothership.  
2. Omega Cluster : Launches a cluster of plasma blasts, wiping out all enemies on the screen for 5 seconds.
