# *Boid Squadron: The Last Flight of the Darts*

After centuries of uneasy truce, the fragile balance between the Boid Colonies and the technologically advanced Nol has once again been shattered. The Boid, seeking peace, had long since taken to the stars aboard their fledgling fleet to establish new homes away from Nol aggression. Their journey was perilous, their colonies fragile. But far from the Nol homeworld, in the uncharted depths of space, they encountered a new and devastating threat: the Xerath Dominion, an empire of hostile alien AI drones that consume organic material to expand their soulless armada.

The Boid, unprepared for interstellar war, saw several colonies fall before the might of the Xerath. To counter this imminent extinction, the Boid pooled their remaining resources to rebuild ancient artifacts of war from forgotten conflicts—the *Dart Ships*. Once nimble defenders renowned during the days of the First Boidic War, these sleek, agile fighters became the spearhead of a bold new defense initiative: Boid Squadron.

### The Plot:  
The player takes the role of a Boid ace pilot, captain of the *Firedart Gamma*, leading an elite squadron tasked with repelling Xerath invaders while protecting the remaining Boid refugee fleets. These missions are more than battles—they are the last hope for survival. The player pilots their *Boid Dart Ship*, battling waves of Xerath fighters, massive dreadnoughts, and mysteriously corrupted lifeforms enslaved by the Xerath AI.  

The Boid Dart Ship itself is powered by Boid crystals—dark remnants of old colonies that act as energy amplifiers. These ships, designed during the darkest days of war, are bonded to their pilots, making them almost like living creatures. The pilots must protect the core of their Dart Ship at all costs.
