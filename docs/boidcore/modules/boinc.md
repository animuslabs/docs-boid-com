# Join one of 5 [BOINC](#what-is-boinc) protocols live on Boid!

## DENIS@Home
Engage in biomedical research, contributing to advancements in understanding heart diseases and neurodegenerative conditions.  
[Boid Team ID: 11420](https://denis.usj.es/denisathome/team_display.php?teamid=11420)

## Rosetta@Home
Be a part of critical research in protein structure prediction and protein design, which is key to understanding biological processes and designing new therapeutics.  
[Boid Team ID: 36190](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=36190)

## SiDock@Home
Contribute to the field of drug discovery by helping in the search for potential drug candidates for a variety of diseases.  
[Boid Team ID: 312](https://www.sidock.si/sidock/team_display.php?teamid=312)

## RNA World
Identify, analyze, structurally predict and design RNA molecules on the basis of established bioinformatics software in a high-performance, high-throughput fashion.  
[Boid Team ID: 6401](https://www.rnaworld.de/rnaworld/team_display.php?teamid=6401)

## World Community Grid
Join efforts in addressing some of the worldâ€™s most pressing environmental and health challenges.

## How to run it?
You can use this link to download and install your preferred BOINC version for your platform: [HERE](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php)

You can add projects from the BOINC Manager list.  
For example:  
![BOINC Projects](/boinc/boinc-projects.jpg){v-image-zoom}  
Whenever you are adding a new project that we support from that list (Denis@Home, Rosetta@Home, SiDock@Home, RNA World, World Community Grid) you always have to make sure that your boid_id has been added properly and that you are part of the corresponding team.  

You can switch between simple:  
![BOINC Simple](/boinc/boinc-manager-simple.jpg){v-image-zoom}  

and advanced view:
![BOINC Adv](/boinc/boinc-manager-adv.jpg){v-image-zoom}  

It's good not to run more than 2 protocols on one machine as there is a minimum of work units that you should be able to provide every day that will generate enough points to generate Boid Power.  

In the advanced view --> Options --> Computing preferences  
you can setup how much of your resources you want to provide and is BOINC should be running even when you are using the computer
