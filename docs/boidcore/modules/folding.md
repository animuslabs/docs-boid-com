## What is Folding@Home?

Folding@Home is a distributed computing project focused on disease research. It simulates protein folding and other types of molecular dynamics, contributing to scientific knowledge about various diseases, including Alzheimer's, cancer, and viruses. By participating in Folding@Home, you can help scientists to better understand these diseases and advance potential treatments.

## How Does It Work?

Folding@Home uses the idle processing power of your computer to simulate the folding of proteins. These simulations are crucial for understanding how diseases develop at the molecular level. When your computer is not in full use, it will process small packets of data sent from Folding@Home servers, perform calculations, and send the results back.
