What is possible now?

Future Services:
Looking forward, we will be sourcing additional data providers and are pleased to announce that we will be offering hosting services for NFT collections (Antelope Native and EVM) from other projects for a nominal fee. Furthermore, regular users will be able to pin their files to IPFS in the future. Notably, there will be discounts available for individuals staking BOID tokens.
