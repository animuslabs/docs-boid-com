# BOID token

We have a market Info BOT running on [Telegram](https://t.me/boid_info_bot) and Discord Main Channel

You can purchase BOID token on:
- Alcor DEX on Telos Mainnet Native [HERE](https://telos.alcor.exchange/swap?input=BOID-token.boid&output=TLOS-eosio.token)
- Defibox DEX on EOS Mainet Native [HERE](https://pro.defibox.io/pool-market-details/8)

Buying BOID with EOS or TLOS from CEX:
- ensure that you already have an EOS or Telos account set up
- from any exchange that has EOS or TLOS listed send your tokens to the account "swapper.boid"
- include a memo containing your own EOS or Telos account name when sending the tokens. This step is crucial, as it ensures that your BOID tokens are correctly deposited into your account.
- don't try to buy large amounts as it will use whatever chain liquidity that is available at that moment, slippage can potentially be high.
