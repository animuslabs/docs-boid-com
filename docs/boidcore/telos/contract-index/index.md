# Introduction
The Boid system contract is the center of the Boid ecosystem. Almost everything a person does on Boid will touch the system contract in some way.

## Overview
The system contract is responsible for the following:

- Purchase/create a Boid account
- Sponsor a Boid account
- Handle BOID tokens (liquid and self staked)
- Delegated stake of BOID with arbitrary lock time
- Receive and claim/decay Boid Power
- Pay to upgrade a Boid account and remove the sponsor
- Create and manage clubs (set tax fee and owner cut, managers, social media profiles)
- Create PowerMods and apply them to accounts
- Handle key based authentication (no chain account needed for basic actions)
- Deposit and hold NFT as well as locking or burning of NFTs
- System can create "Offers" where Boid accounts can exchange one thing for another ex: pay BOID to get PowerMod
- stats are tracked automatically as global accumulations as well as time delineated (ex inflation per segment of time)
