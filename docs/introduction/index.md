# Boid Core & Boid Verse
Boid began with the mission to reward users for donating their spare resources to scientific research. Since its inception on August 18, 2018, Boid has evolved through various iterations of its reward system. It appeals to a diverse group, whether you are motivated by a vision of a disease-free world, are a gamer with resources to spare, or an NFT enthusiast.

[BoidVerse](https://universe.boid.com/), as an innovative extension of Boid, offers a fresh perspective on the Play-to-Earn model. Here, the community, equipped with Boid Power and BOID tokens, isn't just playing games; they are integral to the development and expansion of the BoidVerse. This approach fosters a unique, community-driven project where users actively participate not only in gaming but also in shaping the BoidVerse and its [lore](https://lore.boid.com/). By engaging in this collaborative space, users contribute to both the narrative and the scientific goals of Boid, blending entertainment with meaningful impact.
