# Frequently asked questions
What is a boid?

The first know use of the work was in part of an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986; derived from bird and -oid.
Surfice it to be that the currently the  accepted meaning is; A computer simulation of an animal that flies in flocks or swarms.

What is BOID?

Boid is an EOS decentralized application (dApp). At the heart of Boid is the desire to make the benefits of blockchain technology accessible to all people. Boid acts as a gateway, lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical users to directly participate in blockchains and distributed computing projects. Boid is a website and software platform that provides a social gateway for individuals to contribute their computing power towards big ideas and get rewarded for it. The Boid platform makes it easy for users to participate in distributed computing projects. Boid also incorporates the latest blockchain protocols, providing monetary incentives for the sharing of spare computing resources.

Is Boid Safe?

Security is a top priority for Boid. We only work with the most reputable distributed science projects, and we architected the Boid app such that applications use least permissions aspects. It is also worth noting that BOINC (the original tech behind Boid) has been commonly used since the late 90s with a perfect security track record due to a robust security architecture. And with our move to Folding at Home, 

When did BOID start?

Boid was created by the founder John Heeter in 2017.


Why was Boid Created?

A computer simulation of birds in a flock. Each “boid” follows simple rules of interaction with nearby boids. Many boids interacting results in emergent meta patterns. Likewise, the Boid Platform relies on computing resources from many individual contributors. These small contributions cumulate into massive real-world impact. Who is Boid for? Boid is for anyone who wants to be part of something huge. We designed Boid from the ground up to be as accessible as technologically possible. Anyone with a computer (or compatible smartphone) and internet connection can use Boid. 


How to mine BOID?

The Boid application runs in the background, transparently taking advantage of unused computing power. The Boid application connects to your Boid account, and can tap into your resources automatically, to maximize your Boid Power rating. You can install the Boid app on as many of your devices as you like. Desktop computers with dedicated GPUs tend to perform the best, but laptops can also work as well. You can even rent a specialised service in the cloud with BOID Power to mine BOID.
