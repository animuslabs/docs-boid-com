## Who is Boid for?
Boid is for anyone who wants to be part of something monumental. We designed Boid from the ground up to be as accessible as technologically possible. Anyone with a personal computer or laptop can use Boid. Our main vision is that anyone, even with basic hardware, can chip in and help shape positive change in the world.

There is a special service run by us called AntelopeX [HERE](https://antelopex.io)

## What is a boid?
The first know use of the work was in part of an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986; derived from bird and -oid.
Surfice it to be that the currently the  accepted meaning is; A computer simulation of an animal that flies in flocks or swarms.

## When did Boid start?
The original idea of Boid was spawned by the founder John Heeter in 2017.

## Is Boid Safe?
Security is a top priority for Boid. We only work with the most reputable distributed science projects, and we architected the Boid app such that applications use least permissions aspects. It is also worth noting that BOINC (the original tech behind Boid) has been commonly used since the late 90s with a perfect security track record due to a robust security architecture. The core of Boid is running on an Antelope Blockchain called Telos. Boid works as a DAO so to make any important decisions about the protocol we need many signatures for the changes to be approved.

## Is BOID token traded on any exchanges?
Yes, you can use [Alcor Exchange](https://telos.alcor.exchange/swap?input=BOID-token.boid&output=TLOS-eosio.token) on Telos Native or [DefiBOX](https://defibox.io/pool-market-details/8) on EOS.
